# Skel Manager (skm)

Version, manipulate, and transport the backbone of your filesystem.

Skel Manager maintains a versioned skel directory. Such a directory is useful
for bootstrapping filesystems.

TODO synopsis

## Etymology

The name `skel` traditionally refers to the `/etc/skel/` directory. This directory is used to initialize new users' home directories.

In `skm` the meaning is slightly different:

* by default, the skel directory is not limited to /home
* the contents of skel evolve
* skel is synchronized in both directions
* skm can manage multiple names skels
